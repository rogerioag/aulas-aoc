Most optimizations for uniprocessors reduce the number of instructions executed by the program, and analyze the properties of scalar quantities using flow analysis techniques. In contrast, optimizations for high-performance vector and parallel processors maximize parallelism and memory locality, mostly by tracking the properties of arrays using loop dependence analysis. <p>In this survey we give an overview of the important high-level program restructuring techniques for imperative languages such as C and Fortran, and to describe how and when they should be applied on high-performance uniprocessors and on vector and multiprocessor machines. The basic issues involved in optimization are discussed, and the compiler analysis required for the transformations is described in some detail. A basic familiarity with modern computer architecture and program compilation is assumed."

abstract={The use of graphics processing units (GPUs) in high-performance parallel computing continues to become more prevalent, often as part of a heterogeneous system. For years, CUDA has been the de facto programming environment for nearly all general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) applications. In spite of this, the framework is available only on NVIDIA GPUs, traditionally requiring reimplementation in other frameworks in order to utilize additional multi- or many-core devices. On the other hand, OpenCL provides an open and vendor-neutral programming environment and runtime system. With implementations available for CPUs, GPUs, and other types of accelerators, OpenCL therefore holds the promise of a "write once, run anywhere" ecosystem for heterogeneous computing. Given the many similarities between CUDA and OpenCL, manually porting a CUDA application to OpenCL is typically straightforward, albeit tedious and error-prone. In response to this issue, we created CU2CL, an automated CUDA-to-OpenCL source-to-source translator that possesses a novel design and clever reuse of the Clang compiler framework. Currently, the CU2CL translator covers the primary constructs found in CUDA runtime API, and we have successfully translated many applications from the CUDA SDK and Rodinia benchmark suite. The performance of the automatically translated applications via CU2CL is on par with their manually ported counterparts.},
