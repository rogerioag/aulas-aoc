Polly Options:
Configure the polly loop optimizer

  -enable-polly-openmp                    - Generate OpenMP parallel code
  -polly                                  - Enable the polly optimizer (only at -O3)
  -polly-no-tiling                        - Disable tiling in the scheduler
  -polly-only-func=<function-name>        - Only run on a single function
  -polly-report                           - Print information about the activities of Polly
  -polly-show                             - Highlight the code regions that will be optimized in a (CFG BBs and LLVM-IR instructions)
  -polly-show-only                        - Highlight the code regions that will be optimized in a (CFG only BBs)
  -polly-vectorizer                       - Select the vectorization strategy
    =none                                 -   No Vectorization
    =polly                                -   Polly internal vectorizer
    =unroll-only                          -   Only grouped unroll the vectorize candidate loops
    =bb                                   -   The Basic Block vectorizer driven by Polly
