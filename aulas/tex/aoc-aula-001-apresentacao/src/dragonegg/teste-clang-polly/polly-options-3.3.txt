Configure the polly loop optimizer

  -enable-polly-openmp                            - Generate OpenMP parallel code
  -polly                                          - Enable the polly optimizer (only at -O3)
  -polly-no-tiling                                - Disable tiling in the scheduler
  -polly-only-func=<function-name>                - Only run on a single function
  -polly-report                                   - Print information about the activities of Polly
  -polly-vectorizer                               - Select the vectorization strategy
    =none                                         -   No Vectorization
    =polly                                        -   Polly internal vectorizer
    =unroll-only                                  -   Only grouped unroll the vectorize candidate loops
